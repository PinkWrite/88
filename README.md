# Word Hanon 88
*An app method to learn typing*

Learn to type by repeating the same word until it fills the box. Repetition is the best way to improve any skill.

Drag, paste, and cut have all been disabled, making the typing areas mostly "cheat-proof".

Teachers, tutors, parents, and other educators can use this to ensure that students focus on learning content and core skill.

This can be convenient on slimmed-down platforms, such as Chrome.

**Instructions:**

Put the files in a directory and open an HTML file in your browser.

Note the three links at the top:

- 88 - for the word list
- CUSTOM LIST - for another list with the same sized typing box
- TYPE - for resizable boxes, one with the same no-paste features
